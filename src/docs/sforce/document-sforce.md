The process of reviewing a document is the same in all business systems: Salesforce, ServiceNow, Oracle EBS/Cloud, SAP HANA S/4,  Microsoft Dynamics 365. Below are a few examples of reviewing and updating records such as Campaign, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Price Book, Product,  Solution, Account, etc. You can follow the same steps to review or create any other document. 

The default configuration creates Menus and Paths for all standard REST APIs available in Salesforce. If you develop any custom objects, create a new menu path or action in RikData OneApp.
