Lytteapp is a mobile application for learning new languages quickly. The idea behind this app is to learn and familiarize new words and phrases in less time. Learning is not a game, and thus, this app is not designed to be a game. It's not a replacement for traditional ways of learning. Instead, it must be used with other learning tools to enhance your reading and listening skills.

All words and sentences are grouped by their frequency of usage in daily life. Each word playlist is designed to last less than 4 minutes. So that by reducing your music time by 30 mins and listening to LytteApp, you can learn 20-30 new words and revise 100-120 words in each session.


<h2>Key Features</h2>
&raquo; Learn 31+ languages anytime and anywhere at your own pace
&raquo; Improve your vocabulary on the move in a style that suits your time and preference
&raquo; Add new words/phrases/audios/images and modify the existing data.
&raquo; Use test results to validate your progress: The app changes the learning and Listening plans depending on your test performances.
&raquo; Associate the meaning of each word with a wide variety of rich images that are easy to remember
&raquo; Track the progress of vocabulary development through detailed reports
&raquo; Learn a language in a way that you can use in your daily personal and professional life

Lists are available for both words and sentences and provide an easy navigation method to all Listening, reading, and test screens. Each word list contains 20 words, and each sentence list contains 20 sentences. However, you can add any number of words to word lists and sentences to a sentence list. When you listen/read to a list, the app shows all the items in that given list, excluding those you have marked as hidden. As you study more lists, you will realize that few words are easy to remember and don't need to be revised regularly. You can hide those words/sentences by clicking on the pop button.
