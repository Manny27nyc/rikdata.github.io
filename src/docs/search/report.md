Reports allow you to show data from various queries and paths on a single screen for easy access and transaction.

As per the latest available version, OneApp allows two types of reports
>1. Simple header level report (Similar to Oracle Infotiles): Header level reports fetch data from a single entity and group it by the first field.
Ex: Showing POs with different status or Sales Order in different Status

>2. Line level report:  Line level reports allows you to fetch data from different entities and show them in a single report
Ex: Showing all transactions need to be done by an operator: Showing Pending Cycle Count, Pending PO Receipt, Pending Delivery, etc. in a single report
