 <img src="/images/ScreenShots/galaxys7/Screenshot_20201017-220313.jpg" width="250"/>
 
 
 When you open the app for the first time, the app will show you the above screen. You can complete the configuration in 2 different ways.
 
 * If you have received a configuration file Link and guide from your admin, then follow the steps as per the guide
 
 * Else click on the start configuration button. The default configuration will load all the paths for Oracle Cloud Application and SAP Hana S/4 Cloud.
Later, you can modify the configuration as per your business need.
If you are responsible for configuration at your organization, you can configure all the forms, fields, charts, queries, etc. Export the configuration file and load it to a server (ex: github.com) from where all users can import the configuration

The default configuration can take up to 3-4 minutes. However, a custom configuration could less time depending upon the number of configurations the app needs to complete.
Once the configuration is complete, the app will take you to the login screen.
