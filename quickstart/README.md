 When you open the app for the first time, the app will show you the above screen. You can complete the configuration in 2 different ways.
 
 * If you have received a configuration file Link and guide from your admin, then follow the steps as per the guide
 
 * Else click on the start configuration button. The default configuration will load all the paths for Oracle Cloud Application and SAP Hana S/4 Cloud.
Later, you can modify the configuration as per your business need.
If you are responsible for configuration at your organization, you can configure all the forms, fields, charts, queries, etc. Export the configuration file and load it to a server (ex: github.com) from where all users can import the configuration

The default configuration can take up to 3-4 minutes. However, a custom configuration could less time depending upon the number of configurations the app needs to complete.
Once the configuration is complete, the app will take you to the login screen.

To login
* Select an instance
* Enter your username
* Enter your password
 
 Click on login.

If you have used the default configuration, then the app will show a few demo instance details. You need to modify the instance details before trying to login. If you have used custom configuration, your admin would have configured all the required instances for you. So, you can ignore the below steps.

## Instance Setup

Click on the plus sign on the login page, and the app will take you to the instance search screen.

You can select the result format - table or list before clicking on the search buttonâ€”the value defaults from your settings.
