The idea behind RikData is to Simplify, Standardize, and Synchronize different business processes using a single app.
RikData is primarily designed as a single app for accessing all modules of Oracle Cloud Application; it can be used for any other business systems such as SAP HANA S/4 (Cloud and On-Premise). The default configuration allows users to use Oracle Cloud (2600+ functionalities) and all the SAP HANA s/4 features available via REST. 

You can use RikData One App with your internal MES/PLM and Quality systems with Oracle cloud without creating any customization. 

###### Configuraion
RikData allows users to configure all forms and fields: 
* Which forms should be visible to which user. (Ex: A technician can only issue materials to a work order but can not edit the work order) 
* Which fields of a single form visible to which user(Ex: Buyers can view and edit purchasing related fields on item maters and Planners can view and edit only planning-related fields on item master)
* What should be the sequence of each field in a form (Ex: while doing a material transaction, the user will view item number before a unit of measure)
* Which fields are mandatory to save a document or complete a transaction (the field might or might not be mandatory in Oracle /SAP).
* The default value for each field

###### Standard Functionality
It also allows users to
* Scan all fields
* Create own dashboards showing data/menus important to a user
* Search documents with various parameters and save the query for future reference
* Create charts and reports as per business requirements
