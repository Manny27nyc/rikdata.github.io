 The app comes with two seeded dashboards. However, it allows you to create new custom dashboards as per your business requirements.
 The default configuration also creates two custom dashboards.

 After completing log-in, the app will redirect to the default dashboard. You can change your default dashboard at settings.

 To view all the dashboards, click on the user menu and then on  All Dashboards.

 Dashboards consist of various Tabs (Usually 4), and you can show various information in each tab.
 Currently, the contents that you can show in a tab are :
 * Module names with icons that redirects to navigation menus
 * Data from saved queries (Ex: List of past due Work Orders or Sales orders in Entered Status)
 * Charts based on saved queries

## Saved Queries In Dashboard

You can create saved queries and assign it to your dashboard for easy access. For example, an operator responsible for cycle count can generate a query for all pending counts and add to his/her dashboard. Whenever the operator logs into the app, the app will refresh the query and show the dashboard's result.

Depending on the type of saved queries, the app will allow various activities
* You can navigate from the dashboard data to specific data. Ex: If you have created a query for all open Work Orders, then you can navigate to a
specific work order from the dashboard result
* You delete a record
* You can copy a record
