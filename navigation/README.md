 You can click on any icon on the dashboard to view all the menus assigned to that module. 
 You can configure which menus should appear in which module and in what sequence by changing the navigation path details.

 You can view navigation menus grouped in a specific business function ex: all Shipping related transactions as a single group.
 The app allows you to create custom groups and assign groups to paths.
